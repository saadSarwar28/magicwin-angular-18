Traditional Baccarat is a simple card game, with no decisions required after a bet is made - the cards are dealt according to a set of pre-determined rules. The best score to have in Baccarat is 9, and a two-card total of 9 is called a 'natural 9' and cannot be beaten.",
  "betfairexchangebaccaratdesc2": "Exchange Baccarat is played with 8 decks of cards and uses standard Baccarat drawing rules. A shoe containing 8 decks is used for a series of Exchange Baccarat games, and is reset after there are 6 or less cards remaining prior to starting a game OR the remaining cards provide a guaranteed outcome for either the Player and/or Banker. A Card Counter table is provided at all times in the Game Movie which shows the cards remaining in the shoe.",

At the end of the first round the player and banker are both dealt a card and the second round of betting commences. At the end of the second round, the player is dealt a second card and the third round of betting commences. The banker is dealt a second card at the end of the third round and the game will end here if neither the player nor the banker will take another card. This is determined using the standard drawing rules for Baccarat (see below). If the player will take a third card, then another round of betting commences before the card is dealt. If the banker will take a third card, then a further round of betting commences before the card is dealt. The scores of the banker and player are compared at the end of the game, with the winner having the highest score.In the event of a Tie, stakes for bets on the banker and player are returned (all bets on player and banker are settled at odds of 1.0 in the event of a Tie).",

For example, if the first card dealt is 5, there are 3 cards that are lower and 9 that are higher, so the computer will predict that the next card will be higher. To help you out we've included a card counter that tells you how many cards are higher or lower and which cards have already been displayed.",

  "exchangecardracingdesc": "Exchange Card Racing is a game of Virtual Racing offering a realistic racing experience. The players bet against each other on a bet exchange market. Just like betting on a horse race on Betfair.com, but here the race is simulated using a standard 52 card deck. The action never ends ad Betfair Games with races running 24/7.",
  "beforetheracestarts": "Before the Race Starts",
  "beforetheracestartsdesc": "Each race begins with four runners lined up at the starting line of a 32 segment race track. Each runner is represented by a suit (Spades, Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds). A randomly shuffled pack of 52 cards is used to simulate the race. An exchange market where the players can place back and lay bets on the runners is available. The first round of betting occurs when all 52 cards in the deck are still unseen and players can back or lay any of the 4 runners.",
  "handicaps": "Handicaps",
  "handicapsdesc": "At the end of the first round of betting any unmatched beta are cancelled. Now, before the race can start, the handicaps are determined. Three cards of each suit are randomly removed from the deck and turned face up. The remaining 40 cards in the deck will then be used for the race simulation. A second round of betting commences in which the players can place new bets based on the handicaps.",
  "duringtherace": "During the Race",
  "duringtheracedesc1": "After the end of the second betting round, the race starts. Three cards will now be drawn from the deck, one by one and turned face up. After each card is turned over, the runner of the corresponding suit moves forward according to the rank of the card (the card values are the same as in the game of Blackjack with Ace always ranked 11):",
  "duringtheracedesc2": "If the card ranks 2 to 10 the runner moves as many segments as the value of the card.",
  "duringtheracedesc3": "If it is a face card (Jack, Queen or King) the runner moves 10 segments forward.",
  "duringtheracedesc4": "If the card is an Ace the runner moves 11 segments forward.",
  "duringtheracedesc5": "After all three cards have been drawn and the runners have been moved forward it is time for the next betting round.",
  "thewinner": "The Winner",
  "thewinnerdesc": "The race action will now continue with three cards being drawn between each betting round until one runner crosses the finishing line. Note that as soon as a runner crosses the finishing line (i.e. reaches the 32nd segment of the race track) the race is over and no more cards will be drawn. Therefore it is not possible for a dead heat to occur. The market for Exchange Card Derby Racing is always settled with one single winner.",
  "thebettingroundtimer": "The Betting Round Timer",
  "thebettingroundtimerdesc": "In the top right corner of the race track view you find the betting round timer. You can see which betting round you are in to the left of the timer. When a round is open for betting the timer turns green. The timer then gives an indication of how much time remains of the current betting round. Bear in mind that this is an indication only, always make sure that you place your bets in time. Once betting is closed the timer turns red.",
