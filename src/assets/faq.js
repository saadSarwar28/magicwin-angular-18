    "question": "Are online sports betting legal?",
    "answer": `There are no universal laws that apply to online betting on a global basis. So the answer to this question depends on where you
    live, and where the sites you use are based. The local laws in your country determine whether it’s legal for you to bet online. The
    local laws where a site is based determine whether it’s legal for them to provide online betting services.
    Here's what we know for certain.
    The majority of online betting rules apply to those who offer services rather than those who utilize them.
    It's unusual for a country to make it prohibited for a person to place an online bet. In reality, we don't know of any country that does
    so.
    We have never heard of anyone being arrested for placing an internet sports wager.
    Legal betting sites are usually located in countries or regions where internet gambling is permitted.
    Basically, if you opt to gamble online, it's quite unlikely that you'll break any laws. We aren't lawyers, and we haven't gone through
    every piece of relevant legislation in every country, we can’t be 100% positive.
    Legitimate betting sites aren't breaking any laws, either, as long as they follow the laws of the jurisdiction in which they function.`,
